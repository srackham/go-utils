This directory contains Go packages for common tasks.

- Each subdirectory is a stand-alone package containing one or more Go source files.
- This is not a Go module, it's just a bunch of source code files.

Usage:

Copy required package subdirectories to a Go project.
You can either copy the files or create hard links to the files.

Copying files is platform independent but any subsequent updates to original
source won't be reflected in your project (this may or may not be desirable).
For example:

    cp -r assert ../hello-go

If you have a UNIX file system then you can create hard links to the source package.
For example:

    cp -rl assert set slice ../hello-go
